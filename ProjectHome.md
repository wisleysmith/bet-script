# Simulation of betting. #

## Version 2 Beta ##
Bet script v2.0 is simulation of betting software licensed under GPL 2.0

## Features ##
All things you can find in sportsbook page except system bets.
Version 2 is a service script not software script. It means script is betting server that serves betting data (JSON) or HTML. Design as service enables easy integration of script in third party software like Joomla or Wordpress.  In demo you will see no navigation through links, its because page is calling service. Service returns JSON data or HTML widgets

## Service and a script ##
Dont think on this application only as script to run betting application. Script can be used as service that enable betting functionality to your web application.

You can create your bet page even in pure html and just call bet service.
